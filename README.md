# Project Overview:
This is a ride sharing project. In this project, I have created a component to show all types of vehicles in UI.When clicked on your desire vehicle you get an input page. This showing you two input fields. In both fields, you input your desire location and click on the search button. You can get some results. Then go to your destination comfortably.
